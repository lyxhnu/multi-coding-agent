# Compaction & Branch Summarization

LLMs have limited context windows. When conversations grow too long, pi uses compaction to summarize older content while preserving recent work. This page covers both auto-compaction and branch summarization.

## Overview

Pi has two summarization mechanisms:

| Mechanism | Trigger | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Compaction | Context exceeds threshold, or `/compact` | Summarize old messages to free up context |
| Branch summarization | `/tree` navigation | Preserve context when switching branches |

Both use the same structured summary format and track file operations cumulatively. Compaction and branch-summary requests use fresh routing session IDs and, where supported by the provider, disable prompt-cache writes because these one-off prompts are unlikely to be reused.

## Compaction

### When It Triggers

Before each main-model request, Pi checks the final transformed context, including system prompt, tool definitions, new user input, images and all returned tool results:

```
estimatedInput + outputReserve + safetyMargin <= contextWindow
```

The shared output reserve is capped by the requested limit, model capability and 32768 tokens; the safety margin is `max(4096, ceil(outputReserve * 0.2))`. The configured `reserveTokens` condition (default 16384) and percentage threshold (default 85%) can trigger earlier reduction. These are independent trigger conditions, not extra safety margins added to the formula. Historical usage is used only when the model, system prompt, tools and message-prefix fingerprint still match; otherwise the request is estimated again.

If the request does not fit, the agent ends that low-level run with structured `context_limit`. With auto-compaction enabled, the session tries shake, then bounded compaction, and checks the rebuilt request again before resuming. It stops on no progress or exhausted reduction allowance and does not report task completion. Disabling auto-compaction disables reduction, not the final budget check. See [memory and context](memory-context.md) and [RPC events](rpc.md#context_budget-and-context_limit).

You can also trigger manually with `/compact [instructions]`, where optional instructions focus the summary.

### How It Works

1. **Find cut point**: Walk backwards from newest message, accumulating token estimates until `keepRecentTokens` (default 20k, configurable in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` or `<project-dir>/.pi/settings.json`) is reached
2. **Extract messages**: Collect messages from the previous kept boundary (or session start) up to the cut point
3. **Generate summary**: Call LLM to summarize with structured format, passing the previous summary as iterative context when present
4. **Validate and append entry**: Require complete, nonempty output and unchanged source/boundary; then save `CompactionEntry` with summary and `firstKeptEntryId`
5. **Reload**: Session reloads, using summary + messages from `firstKeptEntryId` onwards

```
Before compaction:

  entry:  0     1     2     3      4     5     6      7      8     9
        ┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬──────┬─────┬─────┬──────┬──────┬─────┐
        │ hdr │ usr │ ass │ tool │ usr │ ass │ tool │ tool │ ass │ tool│
        └─────┴─────┴─────┴──────┴─────┴─────┴──────┴──────┴─────┴─────┘
                └────────┬───────┘ └──────────────┬──────────────┘
               messagesToSummarize            kept messages
                                   ↑
                          firstKeptEntryId (entry 4)

After compaction (new entry appended):

  entry:  0     1     2     3      4     5     6      7      8     9     10
        ┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬──────┬─────┬─────┬──────┬──────┬─────┬─────┐
        │ hdr │ usr │ ass │ tool │ usr │ ass │ tool │ tool │ ass │ tool│ cmp │
        └─────┴─────┴─────┴──────┴─────┴─────┴──────┴──────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
               └──────────┬──────┘ └──────────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                 not sent to LLM                    sent to LLM
                                                         ↑
                                              starts from firstKeptEntryId

What the LLM sees:

  ┌────────┬─────────┬─────┬─────┬──────┬──────┬─────┬──────┐
  │ system │ summary │ usr │ ass │ tool │ tool │ ass │ tool │
  └────────┴─────────┴─────┴─────┴──────┴──────┴─────┴──────┘
       ↑         ↑      └─────────────────┬────────────────┘
    prompt   from cmp          messages from firstKeptEntryId
```

On repeated compactions, the summarized span starts at the previous compaction's kept boundary (`firstKeptEntryId`), not at the compaction entry itself, falling back to the entry after the previous compaction if that kept entry cannot be found in the path. This preserves messages that survived the earlier compaction by including them in the next summarization pass as well. Pi also recalculates `tokensBefore` from the rebuilt session context before writing the new `CompactionEntry`, so the token count reflects the actual pre-compaction context being replaced.

### Split Turns

A "turn" starts with a user message and includes all assistant responses and tool calls until the next user message. Normally, compaction cuts at turn boundaries.

When a single turn exceeds `keepRecentTokens`, the cut point lands mid-turn at an assistant message. This is a "split turn":

```
Split turn (one huge turn exceeds budget):

  entry:  0     1     2      3     4      5      6     7      8
        ┌─────┬─────┬─────┬──────┬─────┬──────┬──────┬─────┬──────┐
        │ hdr │ usr │ ass │ tool │ ass │ tool │ tool │ ass │ tool │
        └─────┴─────┴─────┴──────┴─────┴──────┴──────┴─────┴──────┘
                ↑                                     ↑
         turnStartIndex = 1                  firstKeptEntryId = 7
                │                                     │
                └──── turnPrefixMessages (1-6) ───────┘
                                                      └── kept (7-8)

  isSplitTurn = true
  messagesToSummarize = []  (no complete turns before)
  turnPrefixMessages = [usr, ass, tool, ass, tool, tool]
```

For split turns, pi summarizes each nonempty region and merges the results:

1. **History summary**: Previous context (if any)
2. **Turn prefix summary**: The early part of the split turn

The previous summary is retained even when there are no new complete history turns. With no new content, no model request or new boundary is committed (`/compact` reports "Already compacted"). Empty, length-truncated, failed or cancelled summaries cannot replace the current context. Extension-provided summaries must pass the same nonempty and source-boundary checks.

### Incremental Prefix Checkpoints

With `compaction.twoPassEnabled: true`, the session can start one background checkpoint at the configured threshold minus 10 percentage points. The single `context-rollover-checkpoint` envelope records the semantic checkpoint and its compaction prefix identity, summary, and usage atomically. It is log data, not an extra LLM message; no second prefix-checkpoint entry is written.

Appending a tail preserves a valid checkpoint. The final compaction receives that summary plus only uncovered messages. Branch switches, rewritten prefix content (including shake) or a different base compaction invalidate it. Late results are checked before persistence; restored checkpoints are checked again before reuse. Session totals count prefix usage once, including when reused by a later compaction.

Compaction is committed before its memory note/automatic archive is written. An archive failure is a separate `memory/archive` trace result and does not roll back successful compaction. `history_get` can still page through saved, shaken ancestors after compaction without re-executing tools.

### Cut Point Rules

Valid cut points are:
- User messages
- Assistant messages
- BashExecution messages
- Custom messages (custom_message, branch_summary)

Never cut at tool results (they must stay with their tool call).

### CompactionEntry Structure

Defined in [`session-manager.ts`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts):

```typescript
interface CompactionEntry<T = unknown> {
  type: "compaction";
  id: string;
  parentId: string;
  timestamp: number;
  summary: string;
  firstKeptEntryId: string;
  tokensBefore: number;
  usage?: Usage;       // LLM usage that generated the summary
  fromHook?: boolean;  // true if provided by extension (legacy field name)
  details?: T;         // implementation-specific data
}

// Default compaction uses this for details (from compaction.ts):
interface CompactionDetails {
  readFiles: string[];
  modifiedFiles: string[];
  prefixUsage?: Usage; // Already charged checkpoint usage included in entry.usage
}
```

Extensions can store any JSON-serializable data in `details`. The default compaction tracks file operations, but custom extension implementations can use their own structure. Generated and extension-provided summaries store their LLM `usage` when available so session totals include summarization work.

See [`prepareCompaction()`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/compaction/compaction.ts) and [`compact()`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/compaction/compaction.ts) for the implementation. For direct programmatic summarization, `generateSummary()` returns the summary text and `generateSummaryWithUsage()` returns `{ text, usage }`.

## Branch Summarization

### When It Triggers

When you use `/tree` to navigate to a different branch, pi offers to summarize the work you're leaving. This injects context from the left branch into the new branch.

### How It Works

1. **Find common ancestor**: Deepest node shared by old and new positions
2. **Collect entries**: Walk from old leaf back to common ancestor
3. **Prepare with budget**: Include messages up to token budget (newest first)
4. **Generate summary**: Call LLM with structured format
5. **Append entry**: Save `BranchSummaryEntry` at navigation point

```
Tree before navigation:

         ┌─ B ─ C ─ D (old leaf, being abandoned)
    A ───┤
         └─ E ─ F (target)

Common ancestor: A
Entries to summarize: B, C, D

After navigation with summary:

         ┌─ B ─ C ─ D ─ [summary of B,C,D]
    A ───┤
         └─ E ─ F (new leaf)
```

### Cumulative File Tracking

Both compaction and branch summarization track files cumulatively. When generating a summary, pi extracts file operations from:
- Tool calls in the messages being summarized
- Previous compaction or branch summary `details` (if any)

This means file tracking accumulates across multiple compactions or nested branch summaries, preserving the full history of read and modified files.

### BranchSummaryEntry Structure

Defined in [`session-manager.ts`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts):

```typescript
interface BranchSummaryEntry<T = unknown> {
  type: "branch_summary";
  id: string;
  parentId: string;
  timestamp: number;
  summary: string;
  fromId: string;      // Entry we navigated from
  usage?: Usage;       // LLM usage that generated the summary
  fromHook?: boolean;  // true if provided by extension (legacy field name)
  details?: T;         // implementation-specific data
}

// Default branch summarization uses this for details (from branch-summarization.ts):
interface BranchSummaryDetails {
  readFiles: string[];
  modifiedFiles: string[];
}
```

Same as compaction, extensions can store custom data in `details`.

See [`collectEntriesForBranchSummary()`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/compaction/branch-summarization.ts), [`prepareBranchEntries()`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/compaction/branch-summarization.ts), and [`generateBranchSummary()`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/compaction/branch-summarization.ts) for the implementation.

## Summary Format

Both compaction and branch summarization use the same structured format:

```markdown
## Goal
[What the user is trying to accomplish]

## Constraints & Preferences
- [Requirements mentioned by user]

## Progress
### Done
- [x] [Completed tasks]

### In Progress
- [ ] [Current work]

### Blocked
- [Issues, if any]

## Key Decisions
- **[Decision]**: [Rationale]

## Next Steps
1. [What should happen next]

## Critical Context
- [Data needed to continue]

<read-files>
path/to/file1.ts
path/to/file2.ts
</read-files>

<modified-files>
path/to/changed.ts
</modified-files>
```

### Message Serialization

Before summarization, messages are serialized to text via [`serializeConversation()`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/compaction/utils.ts):

```
[User]: What they said
[Assistant thinking]: Internal reasoning
[Assistant]: Response text
[Assistant tool calls]: read(path="foo.ts"); edit(path="bar.ts", ...)
[Tool result]: Output from tool
```

This prevents the model from treating it as a conversation to continue.

Tool results are truncated to 2000 characters during serialization. Content beyond that limit is replaced with a marker indicating how many characters were truncated. This keeps summarization requests within reasonable token budgets, since tool results (especially from `read` and `bash`) are typically the largest contributors to context size.

## Custom Summarization via Extensions

Extensions can intercept and customize both compaction and branch summarization. See [`extensions/types.ts`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/types.ts) for event type definitions.

### session_before_compact

Fired before auto-compaction or `/compact`. Can cancel or provide custom summary. See `SessionBeforeCompactEvent` and `CompactionPreparation` in the types file.

```typescript
pi.on("session_before_compact", async (event, ctx) => {
  const { preparation, branchEntries, customInstructions, reason, willRetry, signal } = event;

  // preparation.messagesToSummarize - messages to summarize
  // preparation.turnPrefixMessages - split turn prefix (if isSplitTurn)
  // preparation.previousSummary - previous compaction summary
  // preparation.fileOps - extracted file operations
  // preparation.tokensBefore - context tokens before compaction
  // preparation.firstKeptEntryId - where kept messages start
  // preparation.settings - compaction settings

  // branchEntries - all entries on current branch (for custom state)
  // reason - "manual" (/compact), "threshold", or "overflow"
  // willRetry - whether the aborted turn is retried after compaction (overflow recovery)
  // signal - AbortSignal (pass to LLM calls)

  // Cancel:
  return { cancel: true };

  // Custom summary:
  return {
    compaction: {
      summary: "Your summary...",
      firstKeptEntryId: preparation.firstKeptEntryId,
      tokensBefore: preparation.tokensBefore,
      // usage: summaryResponse.usage, // Optional; included in session totals
      details: { /* custom data */ },
    }
  };
});
```

#### Converting Messages to Text

To generate a summary with your own model, convert messages to text using `serializeConversation`:

```typescript
import { convertToLlm, serializeConversation } from "@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent";

pi.on("session_before_compact", async (event, ctx) => {
  const { preparation } = event;
  
  // Convert AgentMessage[] to Message[], then serialize to text
  const conversationText = serializeConversation(
    convertToLlm(preparation.messagesToSummarize)
  );
  // Returns:
  // [User]: message text
  // [Assistant thinking]: thinking content
  // [Assistant]: response text
  // [Assistant tool calls]: read(path="..."); bash(command="...")
  // [Tool result]: output text

  // Now send to your model for summarization
  const { summary, usage } = await myModel.summarize(conversationText);
  
  return {
    compaction: {
      summary,
      firstKeptEntryId: preparation.firstKeptEntryId,
      tokensBefore: preparation.tokensBefore,
      usage,
    }
  };
});
```

See [custom-compaction.ts](../examples/extensions/custom-compaction.ts) for a complete example using a different model.

### session_before_tree

Fired before `/tree` navigation. Always fires regardless of whether user chose to summarize. Can cancel navigation or provide custom summary.

```typescript
pi.on("session_before_tree", async (event, ctx) => {
  const { preparation, signal } = event;

  // preparation.targetId - where we're navigating to
  // preparation.oldLeafId - current position (being abandoned)
  // preparation.commonAncestorId - shared ancestor
  // preparation.entriesToSummarize - entries that would be summarized
  // preparation.userWantsSummary - whether user chose to summarize

  // Cancel navigation entirely:
  return { cancel: true };

  // Provide custom summary (only used if userWantsSummary is true):
  if (preparation.userWantsSummary) {
    return {
      summary: {
        summary: "Your summary...",
        // usage: summaryResponse.usage, // Optional; included in session totals
        details: { /* custom data */ },
      }
    };
  }
});
```

See `SessionBeforeTreeEvent` and `TreePreparation` in the types file.

## Settings

Configure compaction in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` or `<project-dir>/.pi/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "compaction": {
    "enabled": true,
    "reserveTokens": 16384,
    "keepRecentTokens": 20000
  }
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Enable auto-compaction |
| `reserveTokens` | `16384` | Tokens to reserve for LLM response |
| `keepRecentTokens` | `20000` | Recent tokens to keep (not summarized) |
| `autoCompactThresholdPercent` | `85` | Additional input-pressure trigger |
| `twoPassEnabled` | `false` | Generate and reuse a stable prefix checkpoint |
| `wallClockBudgetSecs` | `300` | Per-attempt automatic-summary deadline; existing zero setting disables the timer |
| `memoryFlushEnabled` | `false` | Archive the committed automatic summary to project memory |

Disable auto-compaction with `"enabled": false`. You can still compact manually with `/compact`; request preflight remains enabled.
